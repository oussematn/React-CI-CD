### Development workflow

Creating a pull request to the dev branch triggers this workflow file. The file runs Node on Ubuntu to build our app and then deploys the app to the Netlify dev website

### Production workflow

Creating a release triggers this workflow file. We can create releases to manage the version of our app. **The code in main does not always reflect the code in the release!**
